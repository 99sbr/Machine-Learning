(1) Data was initially put through outlier detection. We tried to detect oulier asset wise i.e for a specific time getting all the stock values and 
 the treating the outliers.instead of removing the outlers substituted it with the Quartile3+1.5*IQR/ Quartile1+1.5*IQR

(2) We tried to normalize the data with 'L2' norm with zero mean and well spread variance

(3) We used 3 algos. (1) XGB (2) ADA BOOST and (3) Neural Network

(4) after extensive grid search we tuned our algorithms and according to which algo predicted which class more correctly we combined results
and final result with neural net results.
