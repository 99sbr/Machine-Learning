Asset Clusterin.py is the main file.
We careated pivot table including both train and test data set as the time was in continuation by removing 'Y

(1) Data was initially put through outlier detection. We tried to detect oulier asset wise i.e for a specific time getting all the stock values and 
 the treating the outliersinstead of removing the outlers substituted it with the Quartile3+1.5*IQR/ Quartile1+1.5*IQR

(2) We tried to normalize the data with 'L2' norm with zero mean and well spread variance
(3) Then we calculated the correlation matrix and applied hierarchial clustering using k-mean to find out optimum number of clusters

Note: clustering.ipynb is rough file
