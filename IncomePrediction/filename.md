Prediction task is to determine the income level for the person
| represented by the record.  Incomes have been binned at the $50K
| level to present a binary classification problem, much like the
| original UCI/ADULT database.  The goal field of this data, however,
| was drawn from the "total person income" field rather than the
| "adjusted gross income" and may, therefore, behave differently than the
| orginal ADULT goal field.
